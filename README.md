# üòä My Motivation


>During my university journey, I worked for the company Modern Appliances Kingdom in multiple different roles: from a security systems technician to being a graphic designer and setting up search ad campaigns. After graduating from university and enrolling in the Orange Coding Academy Bootcamp, I was required to hand in a graduation project "My MasterPiece". After some thought about what project I should build. The right thing to do seemed to be to work for Modern Appliances Kingdom in a new role. A Full-Stack Web developer to build the company website from scratch as the lack of control over how the website looks from the previous e-commerce managment tool was becoming a nuisance.

2) Open a terminal, and navigate into the MasterPiece folder in the directory you cloned this repo to. Inside the MasterPiece Folder, navigate to the server folder.

3) You need to run the following commands to install project dependencies:     
   `composer install`    
   `npm install `    
   
4) Run the following command to create your .env file:      
   `copy .env.example .env`

   `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`    
   `DB_HOST= 127.0.0.1` ( Insert The Database Host )     
   `DB_PORT= 3306 ` ( Insert Your Database Port )
